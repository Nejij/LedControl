# LedControl
A simple script used by a Raspberry Pi to control two SMD5050 LED strips

The basis for this project can be found at the following URL:

There are, however some noteable differences. This project controlls multiple LED strips instead of just one. I used different GPIO pins to control the Mosfet logic gates.
